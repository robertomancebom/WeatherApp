# WeatherApp
WeatherApp is a web application that uses OpenWeatherMap API to get information about the current weather in a certain location.
As mentioned, the app uses an API so you need to get a key in the OpenWeatherMap API website: https://openweathermap.org/ 

Once you've gotten the api key, you need to create a config file (config.js) with the following content:
 
    var config = { 
      API_KEY:'XXXXXXX'
    }

Where the value of API_KEY is the key you have obtained from the website mentioned before.
